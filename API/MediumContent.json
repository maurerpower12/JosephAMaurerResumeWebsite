It\u2019s not a direct dependency that you have to add to your project, rather it provides the html scaffolding for you to use in order to add the components. Simply find a block you want to use, pick your accent color, pick if you want it to be dark mode or not, and copy/paste the generated html. Super\u00a0useful!</p>\n<h3><strong>Meraki UI Components</strong></h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kOLzM_FiROWF6-7j\"></figure><p>Meraki is a collection of 51 Tailwind Css components that support RTL languages and are fully responsive based on Flexbox and CSS grid.

On top of that it has 4 sample pages to make getting started even easier. They do also have some dynamic components that require Javascript to get started. They are one of the few to fully support Angular, Vue, HTML, and\u00a0React!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/creativetimofficial/tailwind-starter-kit\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation\">Live Example</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall you can see that there are a number of open source options of there to help you get started using Tailwind. It requires a little bit more friction than Bootstrap that ships with a lot of these basic components, but it also gives you the ability to find what component style you really\u00a0like.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of the Tailwind CSS libraries that you find useful?

Super\u00a0useful!</p>\n<h3><strong>Meraki UI Components</strong></h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kOLzM_FiROWF6-7j\"></figure><p>Meraki is a collection of 51 Tailwind Css components that support RTL languages and are fully responsive based on Flexbox and CSS grid. Everything from their cards to the sidebars look\u00a0awesome!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bakateam/merakiui\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://merakiui.com/\">Live Example</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tailwind Starter\u00a0Kit</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7ZFoXWWfUGKxpvVe\"></figure><p>Tailwind Starter Kit is Free and Open Source set of 120 fully coded css elements. On top of that it has 4 sample pages to make getting started even easier. They do also have some dynamic components that require Javascript to get started. They are one of the few to fully support Angular, Vue, HTML, and\u00a0React!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/creativetimofficial/tailwind-starter-kit\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation\">Live Example</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall you can see that there are a number of open source options of there to help you get started using Tailwind. It requires a little bit more friction than Bootstrap that ships with a lot of these basic components, but it also gives you the ability to find what component style you really\u00a0like.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of the Tailwind CSS libraries that you find useful?

But for all the good that the ECS brings to the table, there are a lot of complications that it brings to the table. Enter <a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/\">Bevy</a>, an Open Source data-driven game engine that is built in\u00a0Rust.</p>\n<p>Bevy, which code is available in <a href=\"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy\">Github</a>, contains a number of examples in the <em>Examples</em> folder. Aftering getting the project, navigate to the examples folder and run <em>cargo run\u200a\u2014\u200aexample breakout.</em></p>\n<p>Taking a closer look at the examples, you can see that the Bevy engine and game logic is all built on a custom Entity Component System (ECS). ECS is a software paradigm that involves separating data into Components. All of the entities are assigned unique ids. An Entity makes up a group of Components.</p>\n<p>The benefit to Bevy is that it uses normal Rust data types for all of these core elements. For example, Components are Rust structs, Systems are Rust functions, and Entities are a type that has a unique integer property. Because Components can be packed tightly together in memory, their read time is blazing fast. Systems have a read/write dependency tree that allows for a lock-free parallel scheduling.</p>\n<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>\n<p>So let\u2019s look at some of the examples of the features:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YKFl_FAManYD8f3k\"><figcaption>For Each System Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*110Gck3WDIp6AcS_\"><figcaption>Multiple Queries Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TzU_DaxREyVedf4G\"><figcaption>Spawn Commands Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Scenes</h3>\n<p>Similar to Unity, scenes are a way to compose objects of your game ahead of time into a structure. In essence, it is a collection of entities and components. A scene can be \u201cspawned\u201d into the world (even multiple times!). Scene files can be written out to disk and are stored flat as\u00a0JSON:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/934/0*j0lY5EQ_MYrdEqEh\"><figcaption>Sample Scene json Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><p>The SceneSpawner resource is what you can use to call to load a scene into the world space. Once in the space, the objects preserve their entity IDs and can be manipulated at\u00a0runtime.</p>\n<h3><strong>Events</strong></h3>\n<p>Bevy offers a zero-allocation event consumer system when trying to interact with things happening in the scene. This is used for things like window resizing, assets, and\u00a0input.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*v6vOBTgl3-bA-YGF\"><figcaption>Collider Detection Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><p>So for all the hype does Bevy live up to the claims of being a Capable and Simple system? I\u2019ll leave that up to you to\u00a0decide.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for reading this far.

Enter <a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/\">Bevy</a>, an Open Source data-driven game engine that is built in\u00a0Rust.</p>\n<p>Bevy, which code is available in <a href=\"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy\">Github</a>, contains a number of examples in the <em>Examples</em> folder. Aftering getting the project, navigate to the examples folder and run <em>cargo run\u200a\u2014\u200aexample breakout.</em></p>\n<p>Taking a closer look at the examples, you can see that the Bevy engine and game logic is all built on a custom Entity Component System (ECS). ECS is a software paradigm that involves separating data into Components. All of the entities are assigned unique ids. An Entity makes up a group of Components.</p>\n<p>The benefit to Bevy is that it uses normal Rust data types for all of these core elements. For example, Components are Rust structs, Systems are Rust functions, and Entities are a type that has a unique integer property. Because Components can be packed tightly together in memory, their read time is blazing fast. Systems have a read/write dependency tree that allows for a lock-free parallel scheduling.</p>\n<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>\n<p>So let\u2019s look at some of the examples of the features:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YKFl_FAManYD8f3k\"><figcaption>For Each System Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*110Gck3WDIp6AcS_\"><figcaption>Multiple Queries Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TzU_DaxREyVedf4G\"><figcaption>Spawn Commands Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Scenes</h3>\n<p>Similar to Unity, scenes are a way to compose objects of your game ahead of time into a structure. In essence, it is a collection of entities and components. A scene can be \u201cspawned\u201d into the world (even multiple times!). Scene files can be written out to disk and are stored flat as\u00a0JSON:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/934/0*j0lY5EQ_MYrdEqEh\"><figcaption>Sample Scene json Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><p>The SceneSpawner resource is what you can use to call to load a scene into the world space. Once in the space, the objects preserve their entity IDs and can be manipulated at\u00a0runtime.</p>\n<h3><strong>Events</strong></h3>\n<p>Bevy offers a zero-allocation event consumer system when trying to interact with things happening in the scene. This is used for things like window resizing, assets, and\u00a0input.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*v6vOBTgl3-bA-YGF\"><figcaption>Collider Detection Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/\">Bevy</a></figcaption></figure><p>So for all the hype does Bevy live up to the claims of being a Capable and Simple system? I\u2019ll leave that up to you to\u00a0decide.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for reading this far.

While some\n    find the technology intrusive, the trends say that people are adopting the technology. It is estimated that <a\n      href=\"https://marketingland.com/roughly-1-in-4-u-s-adults-now-owns-a-smart-speaker-according-to-new-report-273994\">1\n      in 4 U.S. adults own a smart speaker</a>. At this point, the technology is at mainstream adoption and is being used\n    by the critical mass of people, so the next question is what’s next and why does it matter?</p>\n  <h3><strong>Voice User Interface (VUI) in Customer Relations</strong></h3>\n  <img alt=\"0*8ZuIMbqRJKdlFh3w\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/932/0*8ZuIMbqRJKdlFh3w\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/analyze-conversations.html\">Amazon Connect</a>\n  <p>While it isn’t new to call a company and hear an automated voice walking you through a complicated menu structure,\n    there are innovations in this area outside of that technology. Particularly Amazon has found a way to help businesses\n    to be more proactive in assisting customers. <a\n      href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-connect-smarter-and-more-integrated/\">Amazon Connect Voice ID</a> uses\n    machine learning to make their services smarter at analyzing conversations in real time in order to find relevant\n    information needed to assist the agent or even to authenticate a customer just from the sound of their voice (Opt-in\n    only).</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/analyze-conversations.html\">Contact Lens for Amazon\n      Connect</a> is a set of machine learning (ML) capabilities allowing contact center supervisors to better understand\n    the sentiment, trends, and compliance of customer conversations.</p>\n  <p>The technology is pretty crazy when you think about all of the machine learning that is going on in the background to\n    pick up on the trends and detect who is calling. The idea here is to give the call center agents more tools during a\n    call with the hopes of simplifying their problem solving equation. In the picture above you can see an example of what\n    the agents would see. It analyzes the customer sentiment, total talk time, and, more importantly, how the call is\n    trending.

While some\n    find the technology intrusive, the trends say that people are adopting the technology. It is estimated that <a\n      href=\"https://marketingland.com/roughly-1-in-4-u-s-adults-now-owns-a-smart-speaker-according-to-new-report-273994\">1\n      in 4 U.S. adults own a smart speaker</a>. At this point, the technology is at mainstream adoption and is being used\n    by the critical mass of people, so the next question is what’s next and why does it matter?</p>\n  <h3><strong>Voice User Interface (VUI) in Customer Relations</strong></h3>\n  <img alt=\"0*8ZuIMbqRJKdlFh3w\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/932/0*8ZuIMbqRJKdlFh3w\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/analyze-conversations.html\">Amazon Connect</a>\n  <p>While it isn’t new to call a company and hear an automated voice walking you through a complicated menu structure,\n    there are innovations in this area outside of that technology. Particularly Amazon has found a way to help businesses\n    to be more proactive in assisting customers. <a\n      href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-connect-smarter-and-more-integrated/\">Amazon Connect Voice ID</a> uses\n    machine learning to make their services smarter at analyzing conversations in real time in order to find relevant\n    information needed to assist the agent or even to authenticate a customer just from the sound of their voice (Opt-in\n    only).</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/analyze-conversations.html\">Contact Lens for Amazon\n      Connect</a> is a set of machine learning (ML) capabilities allowing contact center supervisors to better understand\n    the sentiment, trends, and compliance of customer conversations.</p>\n  <p>The technology is pretty crazy when you think about all of the machine learning that is going on in the background to\n    pick up on the trends and detect who is calling. The idea here is to give the call center agents more tools during a\n    call with the hopes of simplifying their problem solving equation. In the picture above you can see an example of what\n    the agents would see. It analyzes the customer sentiment, total talk time, and, more importantly, how the call is\n    trending.

It can and will be stolen, no matter how many users you have on your system. A hash generates a unique fixed length output representation of a given input.

Even if a bad actor were to acquire the hashed value of the password, they would still not be able to work out what the password is if a proper salt is used.

What in the world is this? Salting is the addition of unique, random characters known only to the site at the beginning of the string that you want to hash.

The reason that a salt is needed is because inputs could potentially be hashed to the same string, but since the salt is random the hashes will then be\u00a0unique.</p>\n<p><em>Pro tip:</em> You can hash and sal multiple times to increase the difficulty in breaking the security.</p>\n<h3><strong>Encryption</strong></h3>\n<p>Encryption is a function of cryptography and is similar to hashing, except encryption is designed to be undone, while hashing is not. Let\u2019s take a look at an example of how to encrypt data in an ASP.NET c# environment. The using aes variable in the example is what is doing the encryption.

I thought I would document how I went about it as I think my implementation was a little bit\u00a0cleaner.</p>\n<p>The first step is to figure out what system you are going to be running this on and download the correct image. I didn\u2019t install Homebridge UI and I kinda wish I did as it just makes it easier to manage going forward. I would highly recommend using a Raspberry pi as it is so easy to get going. After following the basic steps to get everything downloaded, I did the following to run <a href=\"https://words.bombast.net/homebridge-service-debian/\">Homebridge as a service on\u00a0Linux</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/homebridge.service</em> and <a href=\"https://words.bombast.net/homebridge-service-debian/\">paste this</a> in\u00a0there.</li>\n<li><em>sudo systemctl daemon-reload</em></li>\n<li><em>sudo systemctl enable homebridge</em></li>\n<li><em>sudo systemctl start homebridge</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These commands create a system service and system manager that has widely become the new standard for Linux distributions. The advantage of this is that the service will run as soon as the pi boots so there is no need to worry if the power goes out or if there are any failures that cause Homebridge to crash. It was simply\u00a0reboot.</p>\n<p>After you have the service running, restart you pi and you are ready to start installing any plugins that you\u00a0want.</p>\n<p>If you run into any problems, there is a great community on <a href=\"https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/issues\">Github</a>, <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/kqNCe2D\">Discord</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homebridge/\">Reddit</a> to help you.

I have since added a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEVOIT-LV-PUR131-Purifier-Allergies-Eliminator/dp/B06W54K29J\">Levoit Air Purifier</a> to my homebridge server and that has also worked out very\u00a0well.</p>\n<h3><strong>Installation</strong></h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lFFGMmWLK2xJWxG3\"><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://blog.pimoroni.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-raspberry-pi-3-b-hardware/\">Sandy MacDonald</a></figcaption></figure><p>There are already lots of breakdowns of already installing Homebridge out there, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki\">official documentation is really solid</a>. I thought I would document how I went about it as I think my implementation was a little bit\u00a0cleaner.</p>\n<p>The first step is to figure out what system you are going to be running this on and download the correct image. I didn\u2019t install Homebridge UI and I kinda wish I did as it just makes it easier to manage going forward. I would highly recommend using a Raspberry pi as it is so easy to get going. After following the basic steps to get everything downloaded, I did the following to run <a href=\"https://words.bombast.net/homebridge-service-debian/\">Homebridge as a service on\u00a0Linux</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/homebridge.service</em> and <a href=\"https://words.bombast.net/homebridge-service-debian/\">paste this</a> in\u00a0there.</li>\n<li><em>sudo systemctl daemon-reload</em></li>\n<li><em>sudo systemctl enable homebridge</em></li>\n<li><em>sudo systemctl start homebridge</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These commands create a system service and system manager that has widely become the new standard for Linux distributions. The advantage of this is that the service will run as soon as the pi boots so there is no need to worry if the power goes out or if there are any failures that cause Homebridge to crash. It was simply\u00a0reboot.</p>\n<p>After you have the service running, restart you pi and you are ready to start installing any plugins that you\u00a0want.</p>\n<p>If you run into any problems, there is a great community on <a href=\"https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/issues\">Github</a>, <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/kqNCe2D\">Discord</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homebridge/\">Reddit</a> to help you. If you have questions about how I was able to get mine set, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maurerpwer\">tweet me\u00a0here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>So get out there and make your home\u00a0smarter!</strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=86e7aa0f63f4\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

Game Developer Conference (GDC) is an annual conference held in the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco. There were a couple of big announcements out of GDC that year: Google announced Stadia their online gaming platform, Facebook set out to own mobile gaming, and every Marvel Spiderman presentation were impossible to get into without waiting for hours in line. Yet the most interesting talk for me was one given by two Unity engineers on Project DOTS. Going into the presentation, I had no idea what the project was about, but I realized that what the project was trying to accomplish was super ambitious. Three years later, let us see what\u2019s new with the project and see why the project is more relevant now than ever before for game developers.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sSHO20bfLSI4l6jVSqicsA.jpeg\"><figcaption>GDC 2019 Unity DOTS\u00a0Talk</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>What is\u00a0DOTS?</strong></h3>\n<p>DOTS stands for Data-Oriented Technology Stack and is crafted for performance. Part of the way it accomplishes this is by using the burst compiler to translate jobified C# code into native code. To do this they use LLVM which I have far too much knowledge of from my compiler course during my undergrad. By transitioning from this object-oriented to a data-oriented design it allows for the creator to reuse code as well as others to have an easier time understanding the work.

Game Developer Conference (GDC) is an annual conference held in the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco. There were a couple of big announcements out of GDC that year: Google announced Stadia their online gaming platform, Facebook set out to own mobile gaming, and every Marvel Spiderman presentation were impossible to get into without waiting for hours in line. Yet the most interesting talk for me was one given by two Unity engineers on Project DOTS. Going into the presentation, I had no idea what the project was about, but I realized that what the project was trying to accomplish was super ambitious. Three years later, let us see what\u2019s new with the project and see why the project is more relevant now than ever before for game developers.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sSHO20bfLSI4l6jVSqicsA.jpeg\"><figcaption>GDC 2019 Unity DOTS\u00a0Talk</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>What is\u00a0DOTS?</strong></h3>\n<p>DOTS stands for Data-Oriented Technology Stack and is crafted for performance. Part of the way it accomplishes this is by using the burst compiler to translate jobified C# code into native code. To do this they use LLVM which I have far too much knowledge of from my compiler course during my undergrad. By transitioning from this object-oriented to a data-oriented design it allows for the creator to reuse code as well as others to have an easier time understanding the work.

Sure AI has afforded breakthroughs in self-driving cars and healthcare, but it brings up the question of if there should be areas that AI should stay out of. If ever there was an area where AI should stay out of, it\u2019s online test proctoring. These test-proctoring services include: Respondus, ProctorU, Proctorio, Examity, and Honorlock. These platforms have gained in popularity since the start of remote learning, and have met <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254631/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-proctorio-online-test-proctoring-privacy\">strong resistance from students</a>. Setting aside the ethical implications from their data collection, let\u2019s explore some of the inherent problems that stem from using AI in these high leverage situations.</p>\n<h3>Always look\u00a0eyes</h3>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c56dbc17addc8b5384ec636edfc420c7/href\">https://medium.com/media/c56dbc17addc8b5384ec636edfc420c7/href</a><p>Much like Mr. Miyagi\u2019s famous quote from the 1984 Karate Kid, \u201cEyes! Always look eyes!\u201d, most of these systems are using AI to track eye and facial movements during the exam. This is considered fair practice because well you\u2019re in front of a computer that could look up the answer. The use of AI unfortunately doesn\u2019t just stop at video processing though. According to <a href=\"https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/EPIC-complaint-in-re-online-test-proctoring-companies-12-09-20.pdf\">this complaint</a> filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center\u00a0(EPIC),</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cFirst, the AI applies \u201cadvanced algorithms\u201d to detect faces, motion, and lighting changes. Next, the AI analyzes keyboard activity, mouse movements, hardware changes, and other computer device data to identify patterns and outliers associated with cheating. Finally, the AI analyzes each student\u2019s exam interactions, including a question-by-question analysis to compare against other students who took the same exam[86]\u201d. [1]</blockquote>\n<p>But think about that for a second. Doesn\u2019t that seem like they are using AI as a bandaid for all of these potential vulnerabilities in their software? To me it seems like they have access to all of this sensitive data, so why not run an AI model on it and see if anything sticks out. But the reality is that there are lots of reasons why the data might have deviations.</p>\n<p>For example, I love the fact that when taking an online test, I can highlight the question and have my Mac read the question to me. The AI model is guaranteed to flag my exam if I highlight every question on an exam. Does that mean I was cheating and deserve a 0 along with damaging the way my professor\u2019s views my\u00a0work?</p>\n<h3>Bias AI</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ROnxPw02C21kEgET\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@domlafou?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Dom Fou</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>So let\u2019s say you\u2019re tasked with building a surveillance system that needs to have advanced facial recognition and eye tracking. An inherent problem with this is that there is a plethora of outside \u201cnoise\u201d variables that are hard to account for. For example: bad lighting, reading glasses, poor internet connection, bad webcam quality, etc all pose major problems. One such problem is how are you going to train this AI model. You have to train the model so that the machine learning can learn what to look for. I know this because, well, I\u2019ve spent time looking at code to do just this for slot machines. It\u2019s a known fact that facial recognition systems aren\u2019t\u00a0perfect.</p>\n<blockquote>\u201c\u2026facial recognition systems have repeatedly been found less effective at identifying or evaluating faces of color. A 2017 study of facial recognition systems found that darker-skinned females were 32 times more likely to be misclassified than lighter- skinned males.\u201d\u00a0[1]</blockquote>\n<p>So right off the bat, your system is going to have a harder time correctly flagging exams of people of color. That\u2019s a huge problem, and requires a lot of testing to fix. Another undesirable feature is that AI system struggle when someone has disabilities. Say for example someone has a lazy eye. That makes it hard to tell what they\u2019re looking at. Or let\u2019s say that a student has a medical condition that results in a facial tic like involuntary mouth movements. Maybe the people making proctoring software see these demographics as not important, but the reality is these groups are at a disadvantage because of bad software. In my opinion, this is lazy testing and clearly not thinking through the implications of what you\u2019re\u00a0making.</p>\n<h3>\u201cCheat proof\u201d</h3>\n<p>Part of the problem of building \u201ccheat proof\u201d software is that you have to be hyper aware of any potential deviations. This clearly has lead to over collecting data and over analyzing the situation. And because they want their software to remain \u201ccheat proof\u201d they are extremely protective over their code and are secretive about how they are using the data they collect behind the scenes. But as a consumer of this opaque software leads to extra anxiety at an extremely vulnerable time.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/3392696c230e3348467f6a89ea67f77e/href\">https://medium.com/media/3392696c230e3348467f6a89ea67f77e/href</a><p>AI is a bandaid to bigger problem with test taking.

Sure AI has afforded breakthroughs in self-driving cars and healthcare, but it brings up the question of if there should be areas that AI should stay out of. If ever there was an area where AI should stay out of, it\u2019s online test proctoring. These test-proctoring services include: Respondus, ProctorU, Proctorio, Examity, and Honorlock. These platforms have gained in popularity since the start of remote learning, and have met <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254631/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-proctorio-online-test-proctoring-privacy\">strong resistance from students</a>. Setting aside the ethical implications from their data collection, let\u2019s explore some of the inherent problems that stem from using AI in these high leverage situations.</p>\n<h3>Always look\u00a0eyes</h3>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c56dbc17addc8b5384ec636edfc420c7/href\">https://medium.com/media/c56dbc17addc8b5384ec636edfc420c7/href</a><p>Much like Mr. Miyagi\u2019s famous quote from the 1984 Karate Kid, \u201cEyes! Always look eyes!\u201d, most of these systems are using AI to track eye and facial movements during the exam. This is considered fair practice because well you\u2019re in front of a computer that could look up the answer. The use of AI unfortunately doesn\u2019t just stop at video processing though. According to <a href=\"https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/EPIC-complaint-in-re-online-test-proctoring-companies-12-09-20.pdf\">this complaint</a> filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center\u00a0(EPIC),</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cFirst, the AI applies \u201cadvanced algorithms\u201d to detect faces, motion, and lighting changes. Next, the AI analyzes keyboard activity, mouse movements, hardware changes, and other computer device data to identify patterns and outliers associated with cheating. Finally, the AI analyzes each student\u2019s exam interactions, including a question-by-question analysis to compare against other students who took the same exam[86]\u201d. [1]</blockquote>\n<p>But think about that for a second. Doesn\u2019t that seem like they are using AI as a bandaid for all of these potential vulnerabilities in their software? To me it seems like they have access to all of this sensitive data, so why not run an AI model on it and see if anything sticks out. But the reality is that there are lots of reasons why the data might have deviations.</p>\n<p>For example, I love the fact that when taking an online test, I can highlight the question and have my Mac read the question to me. The AI model is guaranteed to flag my exam if I highlight every question on an exam. Does that mean I was cheating and deserve a 0 along with damaging the way my professor\u2019s views my\u00a0work?</p>\n<h3>Bias AI</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ROnxPw02C21kEgET\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@domlafou?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Dom Fou</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>So let\u2019s say you\u2019re tasked with building a surveillance system that needs to have advanced facial recognition and eye tracking. An inherent problem with this is that there is a plethora of outside \u201cnoise\u201d variables that are hard to account for. For example: bad lighting, reading glasses, poor internet connection, bad webcam quality, etc all pose major problems. One such problem is how are you going to train this AI model. You have to train the model so that the machine learning can learn what to look for. I know this because, well, I\u2019ve spent time looking at code to do just this for slot machines. It\u2019s a known fact that facial recognition systems aren\u2019t\u00a0perfect.</p>\n<blockquote>\u201c\u2026facial recognition systems have repeatedly been found less effective at identifying or evaluating faces of color. A 2017 study of facial recognition systems found that darker-skinned females were 32 times more likely to be misclassified than lighter- skinned males.\u201d\u00a0[1]</blockquote>\n<p>So right off the bat, your system is going to have a harder time correctly flagging exams of people of color. That\u2019s a huge problem, and requires a lot of testing to fix. Another undesirable feature is that AI system struggle when someone has disabilities. Say for example someone has a lazy eye. That makes it hard to tell what they\u2019re looking at. Or let\u2019s say that a student has a medical condition that results in a facial tic like involuntary mouth movements. Maybe the people making proctoring software see these demographics as not important, but the reality is these groups are at a disadvantage because of bad software. In my opinion, this is lazy testing and clearly not thinking through the implications of what you\u2019re\u00a0making.</p>\n<h3>\u201cCheat proof\u201d</h3>\n<p>Part of the problem of building \u201ccheat proof\u201d software is that you have to be hyper aware of any potential deviations. This clearly has lead to over collecting data and over analyzing the situation. And because they want their software to remain \u201ccheat proof\u201d they are extremely protective over their code and are secretive about how they are using the data they collect behind the scenes. But as a consumer of this opaque software leads to extra anxiety at an extremely vulnerable time.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/3392696c230e3348467f6a89ea67f77e/href\">https://medium.com/media/3392696c230e3348467f6a89ea67f77e/href</a><p>AI is a bandaid to bigger problem with test taking. As <strong>Carol Dweck</strong> point out in her TED talk below, the power of \u201cNot Yet\u201d is more lasting than a failing grade. The problem lies with students doing whatever it takes to get a passing grade when they should be worried about sucking the marrow out of the class and growing with the content.
