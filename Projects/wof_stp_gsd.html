              With great power, comes great responsibility. Well, at least that's 
              how the line goes in every superhero movie. As I started my first 
              industry solo engineering project, I realized that this is also 
              the case when being the only engineer on the project. Every day 
              you get to make decisions that affect how the final project will 
              look and feel. These choices might seem minute in the beginning, 
              but in the end, these design decisions can limit you or help to 
              make your life easier.

              From a design perspective, this game was about fusing two known 
              game mechanics, Wheel Of Fortune (WOF) Super Times Pay and the 
              Gold Spin Deluxe family of games. IGT has made plenty of WOF games 
              throughout its history, and Super Times Pay has been a staple of the 
              brand. On the other hand, Gold Spin Deluxe is a relatively new game 
              mechanic where players get a chance to spin digital wheels before 
              the iconic physical wheel. The virtual wheel can award additional 
              pointers on the wheel and/or multiplier that help the player on 
              the physical wheel spin.

              While there are always a plethora of challenges you face during 
              software development, one of the biggest problems I faced during 
              this project was how to come with clean, elegant solutions to a 
              problem while minimizing the change lists impact on the rest of 
              the codebase. 
              <br>

              "Big asks" late in development are when a game's stakeholders 
              want to add a feature that would cause regression changes throughout 
              the application. Depending on the state of the game, it can be 
              breaking changes, and it's the reason we try so hard to make 
              everything as robust and interchangeable as possible.
              <br>
              <br>
              The big ask late in development for this game was to show every 
              value in the game in currency (i.e. $5.00 instead of 5 credits) 
              when the game is set up for high limit gambling. While some values 
              were already in currency, the vast majority weren't. It would have 
              been labor-intensive to go to every text area in Unity 
              (probably 200+) and attach additional scripts that would handle the 
              conversion, so a better solution needed to be implemented. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The solution was to create a dynamic display mode that checked the 
              game's settings and updated all of the text areas accordingly. 
              This also required the backend to be refactored to include the 
              correct values so that the game could easily switch between currency 
              and credits. The functionality was even extended so that certain 
              images would be displayed at certain limits. All of this had to be 
              done, while the game was already late in testing so that minimal 
              changes were done to avoid additional regression testing.
